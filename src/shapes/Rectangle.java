public class Rectangle {
}
// TODO: 10/6/23  protected properties for both length and width. Rectangle should define a constructor that accepts two numbers for length and width, and sets those properties.

// TODO: Create two methods on the Rectangle class, getArea and getPerimeter that return the respective values. The formulas for both follow:
//perimeter = 2 x length + 2 x width
//area = length x width
